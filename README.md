# Docker Images

A collection of Dockerfiles and related code for building Docker Images.

## Important Notes

* it should be used only for public images
* images created here should be pushed to the [lonelyplanet](https://hub.docker.com/r/lonelyplanet/) organization on Docker Hub and made public
* at the same time those images should be pushed to ECR, this way we'll be able to reuse them for local development and for running in AWS

## Images
Each image has it's own directory
